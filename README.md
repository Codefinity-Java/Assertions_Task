# Assertions_Task

Your task is to make the tests **work correctly**. 
**I am confident** in the functionality of the 
code and have even provided **detailed documentation 
for you** to understand how class works. 
I believe **I made a mistake with the assertions**
while writing unit tests. 
Perhaps I **chose them incorrectly** in some places. 
I hope you can help me fix my unit tests!
